                        For my final year project during my engineering degree at the University of Pretoria, I undertook the
                        challenging task of implementing LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes in hardware. Leveraging the power of
                        STM32 embedded platforms, I successfully developed a robust system that demonstrated exceptional performance
                        in video transmission applications.
                        
                        The system boasted impressive achievements, including a Bit Error Rate (BER) below 10^-4 within 2 dB of the
                        Shannon limit. This outstanding result was achieved with a code rate of 0.5, a codeword length of 4096 bits,
                        and an impressive decoding rate of 4096 bits/s. These accomplishments not only showcased my dedication to
                        pushing the boundaries of technology but also highlighted my ability to optimize system parameters for
                        optimal performance.
                        
                        This project was not only a culmination of my academic journey but also a testament to my commitment to
                        excellence. It played a pivotal role in my graduation with distinction, underscoring my proficiency in both
                        theoretical concepts and hands-on implementation.
                        
                        The LDPC codes implementation for video transmission is a proud milestone in my career, reflecting my
                        passion for cutting-edge technology and my capability to deliver tangible and high-impact solutions to
                        real-world challenges.

                        <h5 class="card-title">Line Following Robot Car - Microcontroller Module Project</h5>
                        As part of a collaborative effort during our microcontroller module, I spearheaded a dynamic team project
                        that involved the design and implementation of a Line Following Robot Car. This innovative project was a
                        highlight in my academic journey, showcasing my leadership in software development and human-machine
                        interface design.
                        
                        In this exciting venture, our team pushed the boundaries of microcontroller programming, opting for assembly
                        language on the PIC18 platform. I assumed a leadership role in the software development process, crafting
                        the control system for the robot and designing an intuitive Human-Machine Interface (HMI). The combination
                        of precise control algorithms and an interactive user interface contributed to the seamless operation of our
                        robot.
                        
                        Our hard work and dedication paid off as our robot not only qualified for the finals but also secured a
                        commendable 7th place in the annual robot race. This achievement underscored the effectiveness of our
                        software-driven approach in a competitive setting.
                        
                        In addition to the core robot control software, I extended our project's capabilities by creating a terminal
                        application in Python. This interface provided a versatile means of communication with the robot, enhancing
                        its usability and facilitating real-time adjustments during testing and competition.
                        
                        The Line Following Robot Car project stands as a testament to my proficiency in low-level programming,
                        teamwork, and creative problem-solving. It reflects my commitment to exploring diverse technologies and
                        leveraging software to bring innovative ideas to life.
