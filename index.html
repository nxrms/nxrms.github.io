                        <p class="card-text">
                            For my final year project during my engineering degree at the University of Pretoria, I undertook the
                            challenging task of implementing LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes in hardware. Leveraging the power of
                            STM32 embedded platforms, I successfully developed a robust system that demonstrated exceptional performance
                            in video transmission applications.
                
                            The system boasted impressive achievements, including a Bit Error Rate (BER) below 10^-4 within 2 dB of the
                            Shannon limit. This outstanding result was achieved with a code rate of 0.5, a codeword length of 4096 bits,
                            and an impressive decoding rate of 4096 bits/s. These accomplishments not only showcased my dedication to
                            pushing the boundaries of technology but also highlighted my ability to optimize system parameters for
                            optimal performance.
                
                            This project was not only a culmination of my academic journey but also a testament to my commitment to
                            excellence. It played a pivotal role in my graduation with distinction, underscoring my proficiency in both
                            theoretical concepts and hands-on implementation.
                
                            The LDPC codes implementation for video transmission is a proud milestone in my career, reflecting my
                            passion for cutting-edge technology and my capability to deliver tangible and high-impact solutions to
                            real-world challenges. Join me in celebrating the intersection of hardware, signal processing, and video
                            communication in this exciting journey of technological exploration.
